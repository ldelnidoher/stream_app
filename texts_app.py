    <b>Welcome to the repository of the VLBI Analysis Center of the University
    of Alicante (UAVAC)</b>
</h3>

In this app you will be able to find:
<ul>
    <li><b>EOP short-term predictions.</b></li>
    <li><b>FCN-CPOs predictions.</b></li>
    <li><b>Downloadable data in different formats and plots.</b></li>
</ul>

  
In the menu option <span style="color: #fb6a00"><i><b>"EOP PREDICTIONS"</b></i></span> you will find different
parameters predictions, with downloadable historic data files in .txt
and .csv. and interactive plots.  
In these plots you will be able to zoom in/out, select and especific area,
choose which data to display (by right-clicking the parameter in the plot
legend) and download them as .png. This options are found in the top right
corner of the plot.

In the menu option <span style="color: #fb6a00"><i><b>"PREDICTION MODELS"</b></i></span> you will find diagrams 
and explanations further in depth about the prediction models used. 

In the menu option <span style="color: #fb6a00"><i><b>"ABOUT US"</b></i></span> you will find about the 
institutions involved in this project and contact information.

<i>This app is still under construction, so it might change with time. Thank you
