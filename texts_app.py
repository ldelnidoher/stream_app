### **Welcome to the repository of the VLBI Analysis Center of the University of Alicante (UAVAC)**

In this app you will be able to find:
- **EOP short-term predictions.**
- **FCN-CPOs predictions.**
- **Downloadable data in different formats and plots.**
    
In the menu option :orange[***"EOP PREDICTIONS"***] you will find different
 parameters predictions, with downloadable historic data files in .txt
 and .csv. and interactive plots.  
In this plots you will be able to zoom in/out, select and especific area,
 choose which data to display (by right-clicking the parameter in the plot
                               legend) and download them as .png. This options 
are found in the top right corner of the plot.

In the menu option :orange[***"PREDICTION MODELS"***] you will find diagrams 
and explanations further in depth about the prediction models used. 

In the menu option :orange[***"ABOUT US"***] you will find about the 
institutions involved in this project and contact information.

*This app is still under construction, so it might change with time. Thank you
 for your understanding.*    """

 applying **Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA)** in order to obtain a 
 reconstructed time series and the residual noise time series. Using the 
 **Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR)** algorithm, two models are trained: one to 
 predict the reconstructed time series and the other to predict the noise. Both
 predictions are then added to generate the final xpol prediction. Idem **ypol**.

 to predict dX. Idem **dY**.    
- For the **dUT1** prediction, the data is preprocessed by removing the leap
 seconds. Afterwards, a model s trained using **KRR** to predict this modified
 dUT1 time series. Lastly, the leap seconds are added back to obtain the final
 dUT1 prediction.
